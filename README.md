# Reactlit Next Starter Project

Just clone this repo to get started with a new Reactlit project!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) starter project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).
With [Reactlit](https://github.com/mshafir/reactlit) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes) then added in on top of it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
